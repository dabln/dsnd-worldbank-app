## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Please refer to 'requirements.txt' for the necessary Python libraries. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a web app created in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree (https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). In terms of content it's a toy example.

The app relies on Python. The following libraries are used; frontend: Bootstrap, Plotly and backend: Flask, Pandas. The app is deployed using Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk (AWS EB, see https://aws.amazon.com/de/elasticbeanstalk/).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The application.py can be run in Python. It uses the CSV files in the folder 'data' and the program logic in the folder 'worldbankapp'.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The running web app is the result. It's available here: http://dsnd-worldbank-env.eba-pfpnikvk.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

In the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree you're asked to publish the app to Github. I refer to Udacity for licensing aspects.
